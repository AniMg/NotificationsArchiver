![Notifications Archiver](https://i.imgur.com/LiOXVXW.png)

This mod introduces the "Archive" tab.

The Archive preserves pop-up notifications and lets you browse them on-demand. This includes the temporary messages at the top of the in-game UI.

You can browse by notification type, filter by keywords and pin important archives. Pinning will prevent an archive from being deleted.

Left-click to open a letter or jump to a message's target (if one exists).

Right-click to pin or delete archives, in-case the list gets a bit crowded.
